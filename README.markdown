Unofficial repository for the FPDF library
==

This is an unofficial repository for the [FPDF-library](http://fpdf.org). The purpose is to be able to build automatic pear packages using [pearhub](http://pearhub.org). [Support](http://fpdf.org/phorum/) is found at the [FPDF-library](http://fpdf.org) page.

Installation

Import some of the [example scripts from the FPDF site](http://www.fpdf.org/en/script/index.php), so it is easier to navigate what FPDF can do.

It seems someone started creating a [PHP 5 version of FPDF](http://code.google.com/p/fpdf-5/). However, it seems to be abandoned already. Might be worthwhile to import it and finish up the work.
